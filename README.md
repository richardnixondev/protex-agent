A lightweight hardware monitoring agent for edge devices.  
It collects key system metrics (CPU, RAM, Disk, GPU, agent self-metrics) and makes them available for remote monitoring via MQTT, WebSocket, and Slack alerts.

## Prerequisites
- Python **3.12+**
- Node.js **v23.7.0+** (only if running the frontend dashboard)
- Linux (Ubuntu/Debian) or macOS  
- Local MQTT broker (e.g., [Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/)) or an AWS IoT Core endpoint

---

## Install

1 - Clone repositoy and cd to the directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/richardnixondev/protex-agent

cd protex-agent
```
2 - Create and activate a virtual environment. </br>
It‚Äôs recommended to isolate dependencies in a virtualenv:
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv

source .venv/bin/activate   # on Linux / macOS
```
3 - Install Python dependencies
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip

pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4 - Configure environment variables
```bash
cp .env.sample .env
```
Update .env with your broker, WebSocket, and Slack settings.
See [Environment Variables](#-environment-variables) for details.

5 - Run the agent </br>
Starts collecting metrics and publishing them to MQTT.
```bash
python collect_metrics.py
```
6 - Run the backend (bridge MQTT ‚Üí WebSocket + Slack)</br>
Makes metrics available to frontends and sends Slack alerts.
```bash
python backend.py
```
The backend exposes a WebSocket server at ws://localhost:6789

7 - Run the frontend (React dashboard, optional)
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

The dashboard will be available at: http://localhost:5173

## Environment Variables

- **MQTT_BROKER**: Hostname or endpoint of the MQTT broker (e.g., Mosquitto or AWS IoT Core).  
- **MQTT_PORT**: Port where the MQTT broker listens (default: `1883` for insecure, `8883` for TLS).  
- **TOPIC**: MQTT topic pattern used to publish device metrics.  
- **WS_HOST**: Host/IP where the WebSocket server should bind.  
- **WS_PORT**: Port where the WebSocket server should listen.  
- **PRUNE_SECONDS**: Time window (in seconds) to consider a device as ‚Äúactive‚Äù before pruning.  
- **CPU_ALERT_TH**: CPU usage threshold (%) to trigger alerts (e.g., Slack).  
- **SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL**: Slack Incoming Webhook URL used for sending notifications.  
- **DEVICE_ID**: Unique identifier for the device running the agent.  
- **INTERVAL**: Collection interval (in seconds) between metric samples.  
- **CA_CERT**: Path to the CA certificate file (for TLS/mTLS).  
- **CLIENT_CERT**: Path to the device‚Äôs client certificate (for TLS/mTLS).  
- **CLIENT_KEY**: Path to the device‚Äôs private key (for TLS/mTLS).
